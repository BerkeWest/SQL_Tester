# SQL Tester
This project was my first interaction with DataFrames and SQL that I made during my internship. This code takes the deneme.txt file and transforms it into a data frame. Then, it filters the values in the data frame to fit the interquartile range to eliminate the corrupted or wrong data. Finally, it generates a database and imports the data frame as a table in that database.
