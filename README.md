# SQL Tester
This project was my first interaction with DataFrames and SQL that I made during my internship. This code takes the deneme.txt file and transforms it to a dtatframe. Then, it filters the values in the dataframe to fit the interquartile range to eliminate the corrupted or wrong data. Finally, it generates a database and imports the dataframe as a table in that database.
